# Implementing a Vision Transformer (ViT) for the [ADNI Dataset](https://adni.loni.usc.edu/)

## Problem Overview
To classify the [ADNI dataset](https://adni.loni.usc.edu/) into two distinct classes, AD or NC (Alzheimer's Disease or Normal Cognitive), using a Vision Transformer to try and achieve a test accuracy of >0.8.

This repository contains a deep learning model for classifying Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Normal Cognition (NC) using MRI scans. This model addresses the critical challenge of early detection and diagnosis of Alzheimer's using the ADNI dataset, which can assist medical professionals by automating the diagnostic process.
